                        One of its key features, ChemTrak, allows businesses to monitor chemical concentrations,
                        temperature, and pH levels to ensure consistent plating performance. The software also supports
                        real-time data tracking and can be used on mobile devices and tablets, making it highly flexible
                        for both on-site and remote management. Anoplex is particularly popular in industries that require
                        precise process control and regulatory compliance, such as aerospace and manufacturing

                        The TestTrak program by Anoplex is designed to simplify the process of corrosion testing,
                        specifically for those working with salt-spray chambers in compliance with the ASTM B117 standard.
                        This can be a complex and time-consuming process, but TestTrak automates much of it, from recording
                        chamber parameters to managing the loading and unloading of test panels. The software also helps
                        users track and document corrosion test results, including automatically calculating load times and
                        alerting users when it&apos;s time to unload chambers. It supports up to four chambers and allows for
                        the customization of specifications for different chamber types.
                    <br/>
                        TestTrak also makes the audit process more manageable by keeping all relevant documentation in one
                        place, ensuring that companies are well-prepared for standards like Nadcap
